As a Colombian and a MIT Master's student, my music taste reflects my love for both modern rhythms and cultural depth. I gravitate towards vibrant genres like Urbano Latino, Trap Latino, and Reggaeton because they carry the energy and stories of Latin American youth culture, offering a sense of connection and authenticity. My interest in Colombian and Venezuelan Hip Hop speaks to my appreciation for music that addresses social and political themes, providing a sense of cultural solidarity and resonance with my roots. At the same time, I enjoy the poetic lyricism and complex musicality of Latin Rock, which allows me to balance contemporary influences with a nod to tradition. My growing appreciation for Pop shows my openness to the catchy melodies and universal appeal that mainstream music offers. Ultimately, I find a unique harmony in these genres, blending intellectual curiosity with the emotional connection that music brings.
